# Recipe Project

This project is a simple HTML website showcasing different recipes, including pizza, chicken, and pasta.

It demonstrates basic HTML skills such as:

- Headings and paragraphs
- Links for navigation between pages
- Images to illustrate recipes
- Ordered and unordered lists for ingredients and steps

By completing this project, I practiced structuring content with HTML and creating a small, functional website.
